# MP4Me Project

MP4Me is a command-line tool that processes video files. This project is designed to accept a file path, process the file, and output results.

## Features

1. **Input**: Accepts a single file path.
2. **Processing**: Currently checks if the file exists.
3. **Output**: Outputs a confirmation message when the file is successfully processed.

## How to Run

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the `mp4me` directory.
3. Install any necessary dependencies (if applicable).
4. Run the `cli_tool.py` script with the path to the file you want to process.

### Example

To run the tool, use the following command (replace `<path_to_your_file>` with the actual file path you want to test):

```bash
python cli_tool.py <path_to_your_file>
